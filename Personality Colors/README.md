This project is an idea that I came up to with after reading an excellent psychology and communication book of Erikson Thomas named "Surrounded by Idiots", 2014.
The book categorizes the people into 4 broad color-coded types based on their behavior patterns:

* The Red Type: Symbolizes the dominant people - 22 personality traits
* The Yellow Type: Symbolizes the inspired and creative souls - 22 personality traits
* The Green Type: Symbolizes the stable and reliable people - 22 personality traits
* The Blue Type: Symbolizes the analytical thinkers - 22 personality traits

Each category has unique strengths and weaknesses as expected and a person rarely belongs to only one of them - they usually belong to more than one. The ultimate goal is to explain why people often misunderstand each other, since it is pretty common that individuals have various conflicts at work and every day life.

My idea was to create a dynamic website, where the user can input their opinion about their personality traits, rank themselves from 0 to 10 in terms of the total 88 personality traits and present two diagrams. The first attempts to gather only the traits that an individual has (rank >= 5/10) and organizes them in a pie chart. The second one is a bar plot that calculates the average score of all four colors. The two diagrams may seem similar, but in fact they measure a different "metric".

* Pie Chart: Considers only the dominant traits of each color category, trying to find out if a person is more "red" or anything.
* Bar Plot: Considers all 22 traits of each personality type and computes the average value.

Of course, if a person is more "red", then we expect the mean value of all 2 red traits to the highest one. This happens in most of the cases, but not every time. Play with it to discover yourself!
